This project was build follow [Udemy React Course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/).

In this project, I build an online order burger and let people build their best burgers. After that, they will be processed to pay for this burger. They also need to fill a form to ship the burger to them.

Base on this project, I studied how to use ReactJS, Redux, ReactRouter, Testing with ReactJS, Hook and how to use Firebase as a realtime database.

### Tech: ReactJS, HTML, CSS
### Storage: Firebase
### [Demo](https://react-my-burger-9caa1.web.app/)


## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!
